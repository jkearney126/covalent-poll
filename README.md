Code Challenge for Covalent Careers - by Josh Kearney

## Setup
This is a simple react-app that can be cloned and run anywhere.

To start, clone the repo to your computer. `git clone ...`

Next, change into project directory and install node modules. `yarn install`

You can then run the application with `yarn start`

Now open browser to http://localhost:3000 and enjoy!

## Testing
There are some trivial tests for all three components. Being that this is a rather basic application,
there isn't much to test. 

Tests may be run with `yarn test`

## Note on styling
This project is set up with the expectation that the acutal build would be 
running in an existing environment. However, for testing purposes, I have created
an HTML template with the bootstrap CDN link (in [public/index.html](public/index.html)).

Should this application need to stand alone, consider importing styles into the actual app code.
